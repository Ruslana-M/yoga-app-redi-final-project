The inner thighs are narrowed and rotated slightly inward with the buttocks engaged but not hardened.  The tailbone is tucked under but the hips do not puff forward.  The shins and tops of the feet are pressed firmly into the earth.  The ribcage is open, along with the heart center, but the lower front ribs do not protrude sharply toward the sky.  The lower back lifts the ribs away from the pelvis to keep the lower spine as long as possible.  The base of the palms are pressed firmly against the soles (or heels) of the feet and the fingers are pointed toward the toes.  The arms are extended straight and are turned slightly outward at the shoulder joint so the elbow creases face forward without squeezing the shoulder blades together.  The neck is in a relatively neutral position, neither flexed nor extended, or (for the advanced practitioners only) the head drops back.  Be careful not to strain your neck and harden your throat.  The gaze is either toward the sky or toward the earth, depending upon your flexibility.",
